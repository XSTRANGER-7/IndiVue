In this project, I'm designing a VR meeting room for immersive remote collaboration. Users will experience lifelike interactions, including spatial audio, realistic avatars, and seamless sharing of presentations. By blending virtual and physical environments, our solution aims to revolutionize remote meetings, enhancing engagement and productivity.
